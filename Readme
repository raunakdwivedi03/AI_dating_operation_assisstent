# ❤️ AI Dating Operations Assistant

An AI-powered dating bio generator built using a **multi-agent architecture**
(Planner → Executor → Verifier) and a **Large Language Model (LLM)**.

The project runs completely **locally on localhost** and produces a **full end-to-end result**
from user input to a final dating bio.

This repository is structured so that evaluators can clone the repo, run one command,
and verify the system end-to-end using this README only.
